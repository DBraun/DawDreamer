# DawDreamer

DawDreamer is an audio-processing Python framework supporting core [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) features:
* audio playback
* VST MIDI instruments
* VST effects
* [FAUST](http://faust.grame.fr/)
* Time-stretching and looping according to warp markers
* Pitch-warping
* Parameter automation

DawDreamer's foundation is [JUCE](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE), with a user-friendly Python interface thanks to [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). DawDreamer evolved from an earlier VSTi audio "renderer", [RenderMan](https://github.com/fedden/RenderMan).

## Basic Example
```python
import dawdreamer as daw
import numpy as np
from scipy.io import wavfile
import librosa

SAMPLE_RATE = 44100
BUFFER_SIZE = 128 # For speed when not using automation, choose a larger buffer such as 512.
SYNTH_PLUGIN = "C:/path/to/synth.dll"  # for instruments, DLLs work.
SYNTH_PRESET = "C:/path/to/preset.fxp"
REVERB_PLUGIN = "C:/path/to/reverb.dll"  # for effects, both DLLs and .vst3 files work
VOCALS_PATH = "C:/path/to/vocals.wav"
PIANO_PATH = "C:/path/to/piano.wav"
SAMPLE_PATH = "C:/path/to/clap.wav"  # sound to be used for sampler instrument.

def load_audio_file(file_path, duration=None):
  sig, rate = librosa.load(file_path, duration=duration, mono=False, sr=SAMPLE_RATE)
  assert(rate == SAMPLE_RATE)
  return sig

def make_sine(freq: float, duration: float, sr=SAMPLE_RATE):
  """Return sine wave based on freq in Hz and duration in seconds"""
  N = int(duration * sr) # Number of samples 
  return np.sin(np.pi*2.*freq*np.arange(N)/sr)

# Make an engine. We'll only need one.
engine = daw.RenderEngine(SAMPLE_RATE, BUFFER_SIZE)
engine.set_bpm(120.)  # default is 120.

DURATION = 10 # How many seconds we want to render.

vocals = load_audio_file(VOCALS_PATH, duration=10.)
piano = load_audio_file(PIANO_PATH, duration=10.)

# Make a processor and give it the name "my_synth", which we must remember later.
synth = engine.make_plugin_processor("my_synth", SYNTH_PLUGIN)
synth.load_preset(SYNTH_PRESET)
synth.set_parameter(5, 0.1234) # override a specific parameter.
synth.load_midi("C:/path/to/song.mid")
# We can also add notes one at a time.
synth.add_midi_note(67, 127, 0.5, .25) # (MIDI note, velocity, start sec, duration sec)

# We can automate VST parameters over time. First, we must know the parameter names.
# Get a list of dictionaries where each dictionary describes a controllable parameter.
print(synth.get_plugin_parameters_description()) 
print(synth.get_parameter_name(1)) # For Serum, returns "A Pan" (the panning of oscillator A)
synth.set_automation("A Pan", make_sine(.5, DURATION)) # 0.5 Hz sine wave.

# The sampler processor works like the plugin processor.
# Provide audio for the sample, and then provide MIDI.
# The note value affects the pitch and playback speed of the sample.
# There are basic sampler parameters such as ADSR for volume and filters which you can
# inspect with `get_parameters_description()`
sampler = engine.make_sampler_processor("my_sampler", load_audio_file(SAMPLE_PATH))
# sampler.set_data(load_audio_file(SAMPLE_PATH_2))  # this is allowed too at any time.
print(sampler.get_parameters_description())
sampler.set_parameter(0, 60./127.)  # set the center frequency to middle C (60)
sampler.set_parameter(3, 0.1234) # override some other parameter.
sampler.load_midi("C:/path/to/sampler_rhythm.mid")
# We can also add notes one at a time.
sampler.add_midi_note(67, 127, 0.5, .25) # (MIDI note, velocity, start sec, duration sec)

# We can make basic signal processors such as filters and automate their parameters.
filter_processor = engine.make_filter_processor("filter", "high", 7000.0, .5, 1.)
freq_automation = make_sine(.5, DURATION)*5000. + 7000. # 0.5 Hz sine wave centered at 7000 with amp 5000.
filter_processor.set_automation("freq", freq_automation) # argument is single channel numpy array.
freq_automation = filter_processor.get_automation("freq")  # You can get the automation of most processor parameters.

# Graph idea is based on https://github.com/magenta/ddsp#processorgroup-with-a-list
# A graph is a meaningfully ordered list of tuples.
# In each tuple, the first item is an audio processor.
# The second item is this audio processor's list of input processors.
# You must create each processor with a unique name
# and refer to these unique names in the lists of inputs.
# The audio from the last tuple's processor will be accessed automatically later by engine.get_audio()
graph = [
  (synth, []),  # synth takes no inputs, so we give an empty list.
  (sampler, []),  # sampler takes no inputs.
  (engine.make_reverb_processor("reverb"), ["my_synth"]), # Apply JUCE reverb to the synth named earlier
  (engine.make_plugin_processor("more_reverb", REVERB_PLUGIN), ["reverb"]), # Apply VST reverb
  (engine.make_playback_processor("vocals", vocals), []), # Playback has no inputs.
  (filter_processor, ["vocals"]), # High-pass filter with automation set earlier.
  (engine.make_add_processor("added"), ["more_reverb", "filter", "my_sampler"])
]

engine.load_graph(graph)

engine.render(DURATION)  # Render 10 seconds audio.
audio = engine.get_audio()  # Returns numpy.ndarray shaped (2, NUM_SAMPLES)
wavfile.write('my_song.wav', SAMPLE_RATE, audio.transpose()) # don't forget to transpose!

# You can modify processors without recreating the graph.
synth.load("C:/path/to/other_preset.fxp")
engine.render(DURATION)  # render audio again!
```

## Building / Installation

### All Platforms

You can find a working Linux Make file, Visual Studio Solution, and Xcode Project in the `Builds/` folder. If the build for your platform isn't working, you should use [JUCE's Projucer](https://juce.com/get-juce) to open `DawDreamer.jucer` and create it.

### Windows

DawDreamer has been tested with Visual Studio 2019 and VS2019 Build Tools (v142).

On Windows, the JUCE project makes several assumptions about having a Python 3.8 virtual environment located at `C:/Python38dawdreamer`.  You can use a different virtual environment as long as you modify all references in `DawDreamer.jucer`, which is actually a text file.

Install [Python 3.8.x Windows x86-64](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) to `C:/Python38`. Use [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) to create a virtual environment: 
`python -m venv C:/Python38dawdreamer`

In this repo, use `env.bat` to activate the virtual environment.

With the Projucer, open `DawDreamer.jucer`. Use it to create a Visual Studio solution and then build in Release mode. Note the post-build command, which moves the recently built `dawdreamer.dll` to `C:/Python38dawdreamer`. Also copy `thirdparty/libfaust/win-x64/Release/bin/faust.dll` to this directory.

Now you can activate the virtual environment and import dawdreamer:

    C:/Python38dawdreamer/Scripts/activate.bat
    python
    >> import dawdreamer as daw
    >> engine = daw.RenderEngine(44100,512)

### MacOS

The macOS Deployment Target is 10.15. This can be changed from either the Projucer or in Xcode.

Install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/) with the universal installer.

Use Projucer and DawDreamer.jucer to create an Xcode project or use `Builds/MacOSX/DawDreamer.xcodeproj`. There's a bug in the JUCE projucer app that causes the generated shared object to be suffixed with `dylib`. This means python won't be able to import the module. Until this bug is fixed, change directory into the `Builds/MacOSX/build/<Debug/Release>` (depending on your Xcode scheme) and run:
```bash
mv dawdreamer.so.dylib dawdreamer.so
otool -L dawdreamer.so
install_name_tool -change @rpath/libfaust.2.dylib @loader_path/libfaust.2.dylib dawdreamer.so
otool -L dawdreamer.so
```

Note that the `otool` commands above don't serve a functional purpose. They just display the before and after of the change made with the `install_name_tool` command.

Move `dawdreamer.so` to a directory of your choice. Then find `thirdparty/libfaust/darwin-x64/Release/libfaust.a`, rename it to `libfaust.2.dylib` and place it next to `dawdreamer.so`.

Then try `DawDreamer`:
    
    python3
    >> import dawdreamer as daw
    >> engine = daw.RenderEngine(44100,512)


### Linux

To build `DawDreamer` on Linux, refer to the steps inside the `Dockerfile`.

### Docker

To build an image with the `Dockerfile`, run:

```bash
docker build -t dawdreamer .
```

## FAUST

Faust on Linux relies on the Ubuntu package service, so if you used the Dockerfile, no extra steps are necessary. For Windows and macOS, Faust features depend on precompiled libraries in `thirdparty/libfaust`. If you'd like to compile these yourself, please follow the instructions for [TD-FAUST](https://github.com/DBraun/TD-Faust/) (Downloading TouchDesigner is not necessary).

### Windows

In the Projucer, an extra configuration exists for Visual Studio 2019 **with FAUST**. 

Run the latest `win64.exe` installer from FAUST's [releases](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases). After installing, copy the `.lib` files from `C:/Program Files/Faust/share/faust/` to `C:/share/faust/`. The reason is that we're using `C:/Python38dawdreamer/python.exe`, so the sibling directory would be `C:/share/faust`. If you're running python from a different location, you can determine the different location for the `share/faust/*.lib` files.

### macOS

Open the latest `.dmg` installer from FAUST's [releases](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/releases). Copy the `.lib` files from `Faust-2.X.X/share/faust/` to either `/usr/local/share/faust/*.lib` or `/usr/share/faust/*.lib`.

### Using FAUST processors

Let's start by looking at FAUST DSP files, which end in `.dsp`. For convenience, the standard library is always imported, so you don't need to `import("stdfaust.lib");` All code must result in processors with 2 outputs and an even number of inputs. Here's an example using a demo stereo reverb:

#### **faust_reverb.dsp:**
```dsp
process = dm.zita_light;
```

#### **faust_test.py:**
```python
DSP_PATH = "C:/path/to/faust_reverb.dsp"  # Must be absolute path
faust_processor = engine.make_faust_processor("faust", DSP_PATH)
# faust_processor.set_dsp(DSP_PATH)  # You can do this anytime.

print(faust_processor.get_parameters_description())

# You can set parameters by index or by address.
faust_processor.set_parameter("/Zita_Light/Dry/Wet_Mix", 1.)
faust_processor.set_parameter(0, 1.)

# Unlike VSTs, these parameters aren't necessarily 0-1 values.
# For example, if you program your FAUST code to have a 15000 kHz filter cutoff
# you can set it naturally:
#     faust_processor.set_parameter(7, 15000)

print('val: ', faust_processor.get_parameter("/Zita_Light/Dry/Wet_Mix"))
print('val: ', faust_processor.get_parameter(0))

graph = [
  (engine.make_playback_processor("piano", load_audio_file("piano.wav")), []),
  (faust_processor, ["piano"])
]

engine.load_graph(graph)
engine.render(DURATION)
```

Here's an example that mixes two stereo inputs into one stereo output and applies a low-pass filter.

#### **dsp_4_channels.dsp:**
```dsp
declare name "MyEffect";
myFilter= fi.lowpass(10, hslider("cutoff",  15000.,  20,  20000,  .01));
process = _, _, _, _ :> myFilter, myFilter;
```

#### **faust_test_stereo_mixdown.py:**
```python
DSP_PATH = "C:/path/to/dsp_4_channels.dsp"  # Must be absolute path
faust_processor = engine.make_faust_processor("faust", DSP_PATH)
print(faust_processor.get_parameters_description())
faust_processor.set_parameter("/MyEffect/cutoff", 7000.0)  # Change the cutoff frequency.
# or set automation like this
faust_processor.set_automation("/MyEffect/cutoff", 15000+5000*make_sine(2, DURATION))
graph = [
  (engine.make_playback_processor("piano", load_audio_file("piano.wav")), []),
  (engine.make_playback_processor("vocals", load_audio_file("vocals.wav")), []),
  (faust_processor, ["piano", "vocals"])
]

engine.load_graph(graph)
engine.render(DURATION)
```

Polyphony is supported too. You simply need to provide DSP code that refers to correctly named parameters such as `freq` or `note`, `gain`, and `gate`. For more information, see the FAUST [manual](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/midi/#standard-polyphony-parameters). In DawDreamer, you must set the number of voices on the processor to 1 or higher. 0 disables polyphony. Refer to `tests/test_faust_poly.py`.

## Pitch-stretching and Time-stretching with Warp Markers

Time-stretching and pitch-stretching are currently available on Windows thanks to [Rubberband](https://github.com/breakfastquay/rubberband/).

```python

# Pretend that the input audio is actually 120 BPM,
# but we want to play it back at 130 BPM and 2 semitones higher.

SAMPLE_PATH = "drums.wav"

engine = daw.RenderEngine(SAMPLE_RATE, BUFFER_SIZE)
engine.set_bpm(130.)

playback_processor = engine.make_playbackwarp_processor("drums", load_audio_file(SAMPLE_PATH))
playback_processor.set_time_ratio(2.)  # Play back in twice the amount of time (i.e., slowed down).
playback_processor.transpose = 2.  # Up 2 semitones.

graph = [
  (playback_processor, []),
]

assert(engine.load_graph(graph))
```

You can set an Ableton Live `.asd` file containing warp markers to do beat-matching:

```python
playback_processor.set_data(load_audio_file("synth_loop.wav"))
assert(playback_processor.set_clip_file("synth_loop.wav.asd"))
```

This will set several properties:
* `.start_marker` (float) : Start marker position in beats relative to 1.1.1
* `.end_marker` (float) : End marker position in beats relative to 1.1.1
* `.loop_start` (float) : Loop start position in beats relative to 1.1.1
* `.loop_end` (float) : Loop end position in beats relative to 1.1.1
* `.warp_on` (bool) : Whether warping is enabled
* `.loop_on` (bool) : Whether looping is enabled

Any of these properties can be changed after an `.asd` file is loaded.

If `.warp_on` is True, then any value set by `.set_time_ratio()` will be ignored. If `.warp_on` is False, then the `start_marker` and `loop_start` are the first sample of the audio, and the `end_marker` and `loop_end` are the last sample.

With `set_clip_positions`, you can use the same audio clip at multiple places along the timeline.

```python
playback_processor.set_clip_positions([[0., 4., 0.], [5., 9., 1.]])
```

Each tuple of three numbers is the (global timeline clip start, global timeline clip end, local clip offset). Imagine dragging a clip onto an arrangement view. The clip start and clip end are the bounds of the clip on the global timeline. The local clip offset is an offset to the start marker set by the ASD file. In the example above, the first clip starts at 0 beats, ends at 4 beats, and has no offset. The second clip starts at 5 beats, ends at 9 beats, and has a 1 beat clip offset.

## Tests

Go to the `tests` directory and run `pytest .`

## License

If you use DawDreamer, you must obey the licenses of JUCE, pybind11, Libsamplerate, Rubberband, Steinberg VST2/3, FAUST.
