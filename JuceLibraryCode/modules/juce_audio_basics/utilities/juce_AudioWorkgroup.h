/**
    A handle to an audio workgroup, which is a collection of realtime threads
    working together to produce audio by a common deadline.

    You can use this class to join a real-time worker thread to a workgroup.
    Rather than constructing instances of this class directly, you should use
    functions like AudioProcessor::audioWorkgroupContextChanged() and
    AudioIODevice::getWorkgroup() to fetch an engaged workgroup from the system.

    The class contains a single method, join(). Call this from your real-time
    thread to with register this workgroup.

    Here's an example of how you might use this class:

    @code
    Constructor()
    {
        startRealtimeThread (RealtimeThreadOptions{}.withApproximateAudioProcessingTime (samplesPerFrame, sampleRate));
        or
        startRealtimeThread (RealtimeThreadOptions{}.withProcessingTimeMs (10));
    }

    void Thread::run() override
    {
        WorkgroupToken token;

        getWorkgroup().join (token);

        while (wait (-1) && ! threadShouldExit())
        {
            // If the workgroup has changed, rejoin the workgroup with the same token.
            if (workgroupChanged())
                getWorkgroup().join (token);

            // Perform the work here
        }
    }

    void AudioProcessor::processBlock()
    {
        workerThread->notify();
    }
    @endcode

    @see Thread, AudioProcessor, WorkgroupToken

    @tags{Audio}

class AudioWorkgroup

    */

    AudioWorkgroup (const AudioWorkgroup&);

    /** Copy assignment operator. */
    AudioWorkgroup& operator= (const AudioWorkgroup& other)
    {
        AudioWorkgroup { other }.swap (*this);
        return *this;
    }

        This method attempts to join the calling thread to this workgroup.

        If the join operation is successful, the token will be engaged, i.e. its
        getTokenProvider() function will return non-null.

        If the token is already engaged and represents a join to another workgroup,
        the thread will leave that workgroup before joining the workgroup represented by this
        object. If the 'token' is already engaged and is passed to the same workgroup, the method
        will not perform any action.

        It's important to note that the lifetime of the token should not exceed the lifetime
        of the associated thread and must be destroyed on the same thread.
