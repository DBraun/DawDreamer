/**
    A ScopeGuard that uses a std::function internally to allow type erasure.
    This can be handy; it allows lots of ErasedScopeGuards, all with different
    callbacks, to be stored in a homogeneous container.

    An instance of this type will automatically call its callback when it is destroyed.

    ErasedScopeGuard has a few similarities with std::unique_ptr:
    - Calling reset() on a unique_ptr destroys the object if it hasn't been destroyed yet
      and puts the unique_ptr back into a default/null state; calling reset() on an
      ErasedScopeGuard calls the callback if it hasn't been called yet and puts the Guard
      back into a default/null state.
    - Calling release() on a unique_ptr returns the unique_ptr back to a default state
      without destroying the managed object; calling release() on an ErasedScopeGuard
      returns the Guard back to a default state without calling the callback.
    - Moving a unique_ptr transfers the responsibility of destroying the managed object
      to another unique_ptr instance; moving an ErasedScopeGuard transfers the
      responsibility of calling the callback to another Guard instance.
