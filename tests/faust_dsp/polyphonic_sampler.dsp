// from substitution with Python.
// LAGRANGE_ORDER = 4; // lagrange order. [2-4] are good choices.

// Inputs:
// * `sf`: a soundfile primitive such as `soundfile("foo.wav", 2)`
// * `N`: The Lagrange interpolation order (compile-time constant). See docs for `it.frdtable`.
// * `sound_number`: The sound number choice for the `soundfile` primitive.
// * `root_midi`: The MIDI note to consider as the root pitch. If the frequency of this note is played, then the soundfile will be played at its original pitch.
// * `freq`: A frequency in Hz which should probably come from an hslider for "freq" with polyphony.
// * `gain`: A gain in range [0-1] which serves as a note velocity.
// * `gate`: A gate which indicates the note's on/off state.
